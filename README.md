## About Me

👨‍💻 I've been working as a Java developer for several years now, and I love it!

🏡 When I'm not working, you can find me at home reading, watching movies, or playing video games.

🎨 I have a strong interest in design, and I enjoy exploring ways to fuse my passion for programming with my love for beautiful UI/UX.

## Current Projects

🚀 I'm currently working on a project aimed at helping people streamline their daily schedules and be more productive.

📝 Additionally, I always have a few small side projects going on that I like to tinker with in my free time.

## Collaborate

🤝 I'm always interested in collaborating with other developers, whether it's for projects or learning opportunities.
